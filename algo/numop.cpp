    Returns the absolute value of the number \a t.

/*!
    \fn std::tuple<T,T,T> gcdex(T v1, T v2)
    \relates <algo/numop.h>
    Computes the Greatest Common Divisor of \a v1 and \a v2 using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

    Returns the result as a tuple \tt{(x1,x2,gcd)} where \c gcd is the greatest common divisor,
    and \c x1 and \c x2 are such that \tt{(gcd == x1*v1 + x2*v2)}.
*/

/*!
    \fn std::tuple<T,T,T,T> gcdex2(T v1, T v2)
    \relates <algo/numop.h>
    Computes the Greatest Common Divisor of \a v1 and \a v2 using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

    Returns the result as a tuple \tt{(x1,x2,gcd,q1,q2)} where \c gcd is the greatest common divisor,
    and the other values are such that \tt{((gcd == x1*v1 + x2*v2) && (q1 == v1/gcd) && (q2 == v2/gcd)}.

    \note This version does not bring anything new to \l gcdex() when used with usual integer types
    since \c q1 and \c q2 can be easily computed afterwards, but it may be useful when manipulating
    big integers because the division operation may be costly.

/*!
    \fn T tpow(const T a, int p)
    \relates <algo/numop.h>
    Returns the value of \a a to the power \a b.

    \note This function uses the square exponentiation method.
